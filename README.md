Advent of Code 2024
===================

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), written in Python v3.13.0.

All the code is well-typed (according to mypy), very readable, and only uses the Python standard library.

Due to the inherent speed limitations of Python, I don't lose much sleep over slow solutions, but I do try to make every
solution complete within a handful of seconds if possible (on a 2020 M1 MacBook Pro). Many solutions are much faster.

Running the Code
----------------

In compliance with AoC rules, the inputs are not committed to this repo. To run these programs, you must:

1. Create a folder named `inputs`.
2. Populate it with files named like `day01.txt` and `day01.example.txt`.

Each individual day can be run by directly executing the file named after the given day, like so:

```sh
python day01.py
```

Or all solutions can be run together with:

```sh
python all.py
```
